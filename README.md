## Build

- Terminal: `make` to get help for make targets.
- Terminal: `make all` to execute a full build.
- Visual Studio Code: `Terminal` â†’ `Run Build Task... (CTRL+ALT+B)` to execute a fast build.

## Release

The release workflow is triggered each time a tag with `v` prefix is pushed.

This repo uses [Github Tag Bump](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-tag-bump) for auto tagging on master branch. It automatically triggers the release workflow.

- Add `#minor` to your commit message to bump minor version.
- Add `#major` to your commit message to bump major version. DANGER! Use it with caution and make sure you understand the consequences. More info: [Go Wiki](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#releasing-modules-v2-or-higher), [Go Blog][https://blog.golang.org/v2-go-modules].

## Maintainance

Remember to update Go version in [.github/workflows](.github/workflows), [Makefile](Makefile) and [devcontainer.json](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json).

Notable files:
- [devcontainer.json](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) - Visual Studio Code Remote Container configuration
- [.github/workflows](.github/workflows) - GitHub Actions workflows
- [.vscode](.vscode) - Visual Studio Code configuration files
- [.golangci.yml](.golangci.yml) - golangci-lint configuration
- [.goreleaser.yml](.goreleaser.yml) - GoReleaser configuration
- [Makefile](Makefile) - Make targets used for development, [CI build](.github/workflows) and [.vscode/tasks.json](.vscode/tasks.json)
- [tools.go](tools.go) - build tools 


### Why GitHub Actions, not any other CI server

GitHub Actions is out-of-the-box if you are already using GitHub.
However, changing to any other CI server should be very simple, because this repository has build logic and tooling installation in Makefile. 

You can also use the `docker` make target to run the build using a docker container.
